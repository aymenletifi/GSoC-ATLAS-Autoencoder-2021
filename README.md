# GSoC-ATLAS-Autoencoder-2021
This is the warm-up exercice for the GSoC ATLAS Autoencoders 2021 project proposal.<br><br>
It's a neural network autoencoder to compress the "four-momentum" of the jet particles.<br>
This notebook is based on https://github.com/ATLAS-Autoencoders-GSoC-2021/Evaluation-Exercise/blob/main/TLA_4D_Example.ipynb.<br>
You need to have fastai and torch installed to run this notebook.<br>
You can simply use Google Colab or Anaconda to run the notebook locally.<br><br>
To install fastai and torch just use :
`!pip install torch`
`!pip install fastai`
